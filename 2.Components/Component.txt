In React, a class-based component is defined using the ES6 class syntax. These components can have state and lifecycle methods, making them powerful for managing complex UI logic.
 before react 16.8 class components weren the only way to track state and lifecycle on a react component.

  In the functional Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree.
